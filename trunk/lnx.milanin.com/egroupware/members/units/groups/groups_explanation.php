	Groups is one of the most powerful features in Elgg. Groups allow you to have complete control over who sees what within your Elgg. You can create as many groups as you wish. Each group can have as many of your friends as you like and each group created becomes another option in the 'access restriction' dropdown menu beside each profile item, weblog post and file uploaded.</p>
	<p>Basically groups control access. When you create a group, add people to it then select it as your access restriction on a weblog post only the people in that group will be able to see that weblog post and so on for all elements in Elgg</p>
