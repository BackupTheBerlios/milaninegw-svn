eGroupware Backup Application v.2004-01-14 joao@wipmail.com.br

This backup is complet new but if already installed you only
backup your complete data in ~/egroupware/backup and empty
the directory.

Untar all files into this directory

Open ~/egroupware/backup/backup/dbset.php and put your correct
Database connection settings. The user you set HERE can be
different from the main application and only need READ rights.

Open ~/egroupware/backup/egw.backup.sh and set the PATH
according to your eGW installation. Depending on your system
you perhaps need to adjust the php PATH.

In eGW administratin enable the Backup Application for your
account. In ADMIN you find two backup settings:

- Server Configuration
- Backup Configuration

Configure first the Server Settings and then the Backup.

Now configure with crontab for a user how has READ and WRITE
access to egroupwares web directory and has READ access to
the DATABASE directory. Probably will this be root but any
user with this permissions will go as well.

ATTENTION: You can tie the permissions of the backup/archives
directory so that ONLY the backup executing user has write
or even read access. That may cause that you can not see your
backups in eGW backup application but they are SECURE then.
You do not need 775 or 777 chmods on the backup or subdirs,
you can set the backup dir to your normal websettings.

Crontab
Set something like this with crontab according to your OS,
most probably you can do

#crontab -u root -e<enter>
and write this line

4 5 * * * cd /usr/local/htdocs/egroupware/backup && ./egw.backup.sh

Attention.: *** change the path to your egroupware web directory ***

The first COl are the minutes of the hour
The second COL is the hour of the day

This setting will run the backup each day at 05:04h and you can set
any time you want.

This application was NOT checked on WINDOWS. But it should work
with MySQL on Windows you only need to find out how the scheduling
works. On NT4 it should be go with at command on the prompt.
