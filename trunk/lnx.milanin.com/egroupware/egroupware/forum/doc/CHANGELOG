[0.8.1]
	- NOTE: Old history on this app isn't avaiable, only in the CVS comments.
	- Converted the non-standard date formats over to the db specific format (jengo)
	- Tables names changed to match phpGroupWare standard prefixes (jengo)
	- Template conversions started
	- Added last post date and number of messages for the category and forum list
	- Removed the your email and your name fields, replaced them with internal account_ids
		NOTE: Due to the previous format used, the update script is unable to convert the names into
		account_ids, so you will loose some message history.
	- Started adding in appsessions calls, this way it will remeber what you where doing
	- Created preferences section, the only option currently is 'default view'
