The following is a brief explanation of how the FUDforum installer works and
what is necessary for it's correct operation.

Inside the setup/ directory, which are you currently in there is file called
'index.php'. When FUDforum is being installed this file will be copied from
setup/ to fudforum/[crc32 of your domain]/ directory where it will temporary 
assume the role of FUDforum's index page. When the forum is accessed for the 
1st time this file will perform the necessary actions to complete the forum 
installation and upon successful completion redirect you to the forum's 
front page. The primary purpose of this file is to copy various forum files 
from base/ into files/fudforum/[crc32 of your domain]/ directory. This is 
necessary to allow FUDforum to perform the necessary disk writes needed for 
normal operation. The file will also need to create several files inside the 
web browseable fudforum/ directory. This will require you to grant write 
permissions to the web-server to several files  (installer will complain 
about them, if they are not writable) and directories. The simplest solution 
is to temporary chmod fudforum/ directory 777 and then restore to normal 
permissions once the installation process is complete.

If you wish to save a few megabytes of space, once the forum is installed
you can remove the base/ directory, it is no longer needed.

By default FUDforum will disallow anonymous user access, if you wish to enable
it, create an anonymous user in eGroupWare and then in FUDforum's admin control
panel enter that user's Login & Password into Anonymous Username & Anonymous 
Password fields. Once that is done, anonymous users will be able to access the 
forum. To control the abilities of anonymous users, use the FUDforum permissions
system. By default anonymous users will only be able to view & search the forums.
