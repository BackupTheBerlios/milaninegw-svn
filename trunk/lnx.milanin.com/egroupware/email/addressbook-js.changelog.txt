Hi....:)... good that one of you three are checkling this...

Difference from the preceding tarball:
-This text file
-Comments in addressbook.php
-The addressbook remembers whatever is in the destination boxes (to,cc and bcc) and this data
 survives a submit. This is needed since, when you click on a name in the source (where the names resulting from a query appear)
 , we do a form.submit so we can go and fetch the extra user data from the database -if, and only if, a) U selected ONE name and 
 b) the More Data checkbox is on


TODO:
- Keep cleaning up and documenting
- When you click on a name in the destination boxs, say, to select it for removal, this thing does a submit and, so, if u have a single
  entry in this places, you effectively cannot remove them (its now a documented feature...:P)
- What should happen is, you click on one of the names in the destination boxes, it does the submit but IT SEARCHES for the extra data
  AND REMEMBERS your selection in this boxes....it shouldnt be that hard but its very very late (4:30) so im leaving

Please dont hate it, help me improve it.... i think this email clients can be cool and easy to use, lets give this kind of 
thing a chance to attract new users and developers into the whole project.

New Stuff:
- Change the name of this file from addressbook-chnglog.txt to addressbook-js.changelog.txt
- Changes in selectboxes.js to support a couple of functions we needed for the rest of the changes
- You now can select a single user from a destination box and his data will be shown in the more data textarea box
- Formatting changes in the addressbook-js.tpl to make this thing smaller...this was supposed to run in 800x600, now i have no idea how
  to cram all that inside that
- The addressbook now remembers everything you clicked regardless of where u did it with the exeptions mentioned in the next section

TODO:
- Keep cleaning and documenting
- It would be nice if the destination boxes content didnt die when u hit a category, sometimes u want to send mail to different categories
- Sleep, but this is no time to do that.... im going to take a crack at a "forward as inline" functionality as a user preference


 
Monday 23 of september
- Lots of caching gets performed so that we dont go and fetch the whole thing everytime we click on a name.
- Bug that made the boxes forget what was in them if u clicked on the more-data button
- Created preferences for your screensize which controls both the size of the window that gets poped up and the fonts of
  the html widgets withing them.
- Your addressbook choice is now a preference

TODO:
- Keep cleaning and documenting
- It would be nice if the destination boxes content didnt die when u hit a category, sometimes u want to send mail to different categories
- Search button still not working...pretty stupid
- U guys go and test it.... id the behaviour is good, i will move to make it a class.... please check it out... i think its production qualuty...im putting it online about wensday

Wendsday October 9 2002
- This changelog entry makes up for the last releases of no documenting the changes
- This thing went into a major overhaul, the js addressbook now is implemented in two classes
  class.uijsaddressbook and class.bojsaddressbook.
- The templates also changed as we moved to an event driven model of two frames, one hidden, one shown
  The shown frame is basicaly what we were using as an index file (addressbook-js.php). The second frame
  is dynamicaly set byu the event system when it needs to go fetch data from the server.
- The particular stuff each of this classes provides will be put into angles documentation style
  once my life is a bit stabler
- Major changes include the hability to select the fields you want shown for user data, extreme use
  of caching to improve performance... etc

BUGFIXES:
- This addressbook now remembers everything with each page submit, actually, it will remember your
  last selections and queries for the rest of your phpgw session.
- This thing now uses the event system for most everything that doesnt involve a query to the database (and ill move that as well)
  this means it cannot forget your selections on any of the relevant boxes unless you requery the database, in which case the present
  selection of the nameselect box is unimportant and the destboxes are refeched from cache.... this baby rocks....

TODO:
- I have tons of documentation to do, i know.... its good that tony doesnt live here cause he would probably shoot me
  since he is so good at it himself... I promise it wont take long.
