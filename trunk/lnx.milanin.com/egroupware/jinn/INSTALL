INSTALLATION
================================================================================
go to your egroupware directory and untar the tarball in it.

   cd /path/to/egroupware
   tar xvjf jinn.x.x.x.tar.bz2
   
If you use the image upload functionality you have to install ImageMagick on
your machine which runs the webserver. For more information see
http://www.imagemagick.org

If your php.ini has safe mode enabled, You have to copy convert from the
ImageMagick package to the root of your egroupware directory. It's also
important that the owner of the webserver and the jinn are the same.
This is because the jinn can upload files if this is setup for the
sites.

ATTENTION
Magic quotes_gpc must be set off in php.ini. Else JiNN wont work. (This will be fixed) 


to set owner to apache and group to apache, type

   chown apache.apache /path/to/directory -R

Now go to the setupapplication of egroupware in your browser

    e.g. http://wgroupware/setup/

and go to manage applications. check jinn for install and then submit
form. If nothing went wrong the jinn is now available, so you can
asign it to any user or group.

If you can't get access to the sites or site-objects give yourself accessrights in the
admin section of JiNN

See the Administrators documentation for information on setting up sites and
site-objects and managing access rights. If this documentation is not in the doc
directory then I did not had the time to write it. Sorry.

Enjoy.
