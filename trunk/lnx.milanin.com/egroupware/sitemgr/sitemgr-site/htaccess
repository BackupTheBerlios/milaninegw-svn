# If you want your URLs to look like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/page1
# instead of like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/index.php?page_name=page1
# and you're running Apache, then customize and add
# the below lines to your .htaccess file, or
# copy this file to .htaccess.  Note that your
# Apache web server needs to be setup to read
# .htaccess files and allow use of the RewriteEngine
# directive (AllowOverride FileInfo). 
# you have to change the RewriteBase directive to the URI 
# of your sitemgr install, and you have to change
# the htaccess_rewrite variable in config.inc.php to True
# from False.
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^([^/]*)$ index.php?page_name=$1&%{QUERY_STRING}
