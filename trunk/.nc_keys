# Format description 
  Note: Parsing of this file is implemented in a very
        simple way, so you have to be careful when editing.
        All fields MUST be supplied, comments begin and end
	like this one. Fields are separated with one space,
        embedded spaces are not possible. Make a backup copy
        of this file before editing. If this file is corrupted,
        nc will behave unpredictably. nc always assumes this
        file is correctly formatted, no error checking is
        performed. Only the labels for the keys M1-M8 appear
	as softlabels in the bottom line, but other keys may
        be defined too.
  The fields are (in this order):
  Prefix-key (M=ESC)
  Key character (unquoted)
  Softlabel text
  File to execute
  doit-Flag (1 or 0)
  wait-Flag (1 or 0)
  needarg-Flag (1 or 0)
  Prompt string for arg or "Nothing" (only ONE word!)
  default-Flag (1 or 0)
  Parameter passing: m0=marked, h0=hilighted, u0=unmarked
                     p0=additional parameter only (if needarg==1)
		     m1=marked with leading additional parameter
	             h1=hilighted with leading add. parameter
		     u1=unmarked with leading add. parameter
                     m2
		     h2
		     u2=as above, but the add. parameter is the
                        last one instead of the first
		     n0=no parameter passing
		     (only ONE option!)
